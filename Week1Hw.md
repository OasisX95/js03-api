# Week 1 - Homework

For this week's homework you guys are going to build a website to view a **random** pokemon's name and that pokemons image. For this project we will be using the pokeapi, an api that has many ~~pokemen~~ pokemons.

You can see an example here

Feel free to talk in the slack channel if you have any questions.
